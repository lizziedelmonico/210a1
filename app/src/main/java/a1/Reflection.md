This assignment was very challenging to say the least. Every time I had an academic breakthrough, I would hit a brick wall. 
Despite having to install a new software system and deal with many Gradle issues, I was able to do much more than I originally anticipated.
One thing that worked out for this assignment was my willingness to ask for help. I went to all TA hours and stayed for the full two hours and
spent way too much time in Halie's office (thank you so much for saving me this week, I couldn't have done it without you!).
Due to my willingness to reach out for help, not only was I able to complete the majority of the assignment on time, 
but I also learned some new skills, such as how to type in the command line and sort through my files there. After a while, 
I also learned what "ls" means. Something I could improve on would probably be diving into the assignment on the first day 
instead of looking at the README and setting up some methods. I think getting into the details of the assignment as early
as possible could help relieve stress if more tech issues appear in the future.

**NOTE** During OH, we discovered that my code compiles on Halie's computer, so she has agreed to grade me on this assignment :)
